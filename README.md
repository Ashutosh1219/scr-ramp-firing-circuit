## Ramp-Based SCR Firing Circuit for Single-Phase Controlled Rectifier

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a ramp–comparator based firing circuit used to control the firing angle of an SCR in a single-phase controlled rectifier.

### Key Concepts
- Zero crossing detection
- Ramp generation synchronized with AC supply
- Comparator-based firing pulse generation
- RC pulse shaping and clamping
- Phase control of SCR

### Tools Used
- PSIM
- Power electronics control concepts

### Outcome
The firing angle was controlled by varying the DC reference voltage, resulting in smooth regulation of the average DC output voltage.
